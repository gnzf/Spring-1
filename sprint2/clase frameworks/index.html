                  <p class="texto1">I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. Ive been looking to make
                  a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                  I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                  The next 12 weeks was thhe best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course.
                  I ve succesfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at VR startup.</p>

                  <p class="texto1">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
                    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
                    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from

              <p class="texto1">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                100% recommend! ”</p
